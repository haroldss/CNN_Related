Welcome to Software Carpentry

We will use this Etherpad to share links and snippets of code, take notes, ask and answer questions, and whatever else comes to mind.
The page displays a screen with three major parts:

* The left side holds today's notes: please edit these as we go along.
* The top right side shows the names of users who are logged in: please add your name and pick the color that best reflects your mood and personality.
* The bottom right is a real time chat window for asking questions of the instructor and your fellow learners.

To start, please add yourself to the attendee list below:

* Daniel Smith (Chemistry, Auburn University)
* Michelle Berry (Ecology & Evolutionary Biology, University of Michigan)

*Miriam Goodman (Stanford Neuroscience Institute) - Please let me know how this experience fits in with your research needs. Also, I'd love to know what you think about the experience...

Shell Lessons:
*Download "Data" from the SWC website under Shell
*Unzip data in the folder "SWC"
*Shell is used to stitch together low level commands

stuck? can't get a 'man' page? try Google "man <your command>"

transposing the notes from the whiteboard to this etherpad:
mv - "move" a file
rm - "remove" a file
rmdir - remove a directory (folder)
mkdir - make/create a directory (folder)
cp - copy a file or folder
pwd - print working directory or shows your current location
touch - create a new file
ls - "list" the contents of the working directory
man - "manual"
cd - change directory (move to a different folder)
cat - prints file contents to screen

Shell Tasks:
1) rename fructorse.dat
2) move fructose.dat and sucrose.dat to raw directory
3) make a new directory called backup and copy both .dat files to backup
4) make a new file in analyzed called sugarscript.s

Shell commands:

one word commands: (do not require arguments, but may take them optionally)
pwd       prints working directory (where you are in folder hierarchy)
ls            lists directory
  ls -F     list directory with indicators for folders vs files
  ls -a     list directory and all hidden files as well (files/folders beginning with a .)
  ls -l      lists folder contents as well as additional details (permissions, owners, modified times)
  ls <foldername>     lists contents of folder relative to current directory you are in
whoami  prints current username
uname -n      print name of computer

Search / Help
man <name of command> (not installed in windows shell by default, use google)
    - use q to exit
    - use spacebar and b to move up and down a page at a time
    - use up and down arrows to move one line at a time
    
Create things
touch <name of file> 
mkdir <name of directory>

Destroy things
rm <name of file> 
rmdir <name of directory>

Move things
mv <target (file or directory)> <location>
mv <target> <new name> 
cp <target file or directory)> <location>

printing:
cat <name of file> 



To move a whole folder:
cp -r Target Destination/
The slashes are very important here. If we did:
cp -r Target/ Destination/
This will instead copy all of the files in Target into Destination.
The reason for this is the "/" describes the files in the folder while without the "/" this describes the file itself.

If you want to copy large files/directories (hundreds of GBs or more):
check out the `rsync` command (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync)
